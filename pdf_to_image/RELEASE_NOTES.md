## üéâ Welcome to PDF to Image Converter!

We're excited to announce the first stable release of PDF to Image Converter, a powerful and user-friendly Python utility designed to convert PDF documents into high-quality images with precision and flexibility.

## üåü What Makes This Release Special

After extensive development and testing, we've created a tool that bridges the gap between document processing and image generation. Whether you're a developer integrating PDF conversion into your workflow, a designer needing high-quality images from PDFs, or a content creator preparing materials for different platforms, this converter has you covered.

## üöÄ Key Features

### High-Quality Output Engine
- **Configurable DPI Settings**: Choose from 150 to 600 DPI for perfect quality control
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Support for PNG, JPEG, TIFF, and BMP with optimized compression
- **Smart Quality Presets**: Four carefully tuned presets for different use cases:
  - **Web** (150 DPI, PNG): Perfect for online content and fast loading
  - **Print** (300 DPI, PNG): Industry standard for professional printing
  - **High** (600 DPI, PNG): Premium quality for detailed work
  - **Archive** (600 DPI, TIFF): Lossless format for long-term storage

### Powerful Processing Capabilities
- **Batch Processing**: Convert entire directories of PDFs in one command
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded conversion for faster performance
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and meaningful error messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging and status updates throughout conversion

### Developer-Friendly Design
- **Dual CLI Commands**: Use either `pdf2img` or `pdf-converter` - whatever feels natural
- **Python API**: Clean, well-documented classes for programmatic integration
- **Modern Packaging**: Built with pyproject.toml and follows Python best practices
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 9 unit tests covering all functionality and edge cases

## üõ† Technical Excellence

### Built on Solid Foundations
- **pdf2image Library**: Leverages the proven pdf2image library for reliable PDF processing
- **Poppler Integration**: Uses industry-standard Poppler utilities for PDF rendering
- **Pillow Enhancement**: Advanced image processing with the powerful Pillow library

### Quality Assurance
- **Input Validation**: Automatic validation of DPI ranges, file formats, and parameters
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of corrupted PDFs and system issues
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized processing to handle large documents without memory issues
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üì¶ Installation & Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install the package
pip install pdf-to-image-converter

# Convert your first PDF
pdf2img document.pdf --output-dir ./images

# Or use the alternative command
pdf-converter document.pdf --preset high
```

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher (tested up to Python 3.12)
- **Poppler**: System dependency for PDF processing
- **Memory**: Recommended 2GB+ for large documents
- **Storage**: Sufficient space for output images (varies by DPI and format)

## üéØ Real-World Use Cases

### For Content Creators
Convert presentation slides, documents, and reports into images for social media, websites, and digital portfolios.

### For Developers
Integrate PDF-to-image conversion into web applications, document management systems, and automated workflows.

### For Designers
Extract high-quality images from PDFs for further editing, layout work, and print production.

### For Archivists
Convert important documents to TIFF format for long-term digital preservation with maximum quality retention.

## üîß Advanced Features

### Flexible Command-Line Interface
```bash
# Basic conversion
pdf2img document.pdf

# High-quality TIFF output
pdf-converter document.pdf --dpi 600 --format TIFF

# Batch processing with custom naming
pdf2img --input-dir ./pdfs --output-dir ./images --prefix project

# Parallel processing for speed
pdf-converter document.pdf --threads 4 --verbose
```

### Python API Integration
```python
from pdf_converter import PDFConverter

# Create converter with custom settings
converter = PDFConverter(dpi=600, output_format='PNG')

# Convert single file
images = converter.convert_pdf('document.pdf', './output')

# Batch convert directory
results = converter.convert_directory('./pdfs', './images')
```

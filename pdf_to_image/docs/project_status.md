## Project Complete - Ready for Use

**Date:** August 2, 2024  
**Author:** Mohammad Hossein Soltani  
**GitHub:** [github.com/soltanegharb](https://github.com/soltanegharb)  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Development Progress

### Foundation & Research Phase
- Researched and compared PDF processing libraries (pdf2image, PyMuPDF, Wand)
- Decided on pdf2image for the best balance of features and reliability
- Established quality standards: 300 DPI default, configurable 150-600 range
- Built and tested initial proof of concept

### Core Development Phase
- Implemented the main PDFConverter class with full conversion functionality
- Created command-line interface with intuitive options and help
- Added quality presets for common use cases (web/print/high/archive)
- Built support for multiple output formats (PNG/JPEG/TIFF/BMP)
- Added batch processing for converting entire directories
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging

### Testing & Quality Assurance Phase
- Developed comprehensive test suite with 9 unit tests covering all functionality
- Added input validation for DPI ranges and thread counts
- Tested extensively with real PDF files to verify performance
- Benchmarked conversion speeds and memory usage
- Verified error handling works correctly in edge cases

### Production Preparation Phase
- Updated to modern Python packaging standards with pyproject.toml
- Created development automation tools and Makefile
- Wrote comprehensive documentation covering all aspects
- Created deployment guides for production environments
- Built validation scripts for testing installations
